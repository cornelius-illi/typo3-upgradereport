# TYPO3 Smooth Migration Extension

This is a fork of the **[Smooth Migration Extension](https://github.com/nxpthx/typo3-upgradereport) that will support TYPO3 Version 6.0 and 6.1. Even for projects with newer TYPO3 Version a migration report is necesary or nice to have.

## Extension Usage

Just install the extension into a TYPO3 4.5 LTS instance from TER. If cloning from github, make sure your extension folder is named "smoothmigration".
Afterwards go to the new module shipped and run the tests. We plan on having a more versatile Interface allowing to export the results.

## Extension Development

The Extension is Developed at github. All issues are tracked at http://forge.typo3.org/projects/typo3cms-smoothmigration/issues using the according categories about "upgradecheck".
The Smooth upgrade project and this extension is coordinated by [Steffen Ritter](mailto:steffen.ritter@typo3.org).

## Participating in Development

The development of such an extension is an huge task. If you read about all the other things a smooth upgrade is about you got to know, that it will only work out with your participation.

The extension should already ship examples on how to implement new checks. If you feel like getting startet, grab an open issue for an check and implement it. You may hand in your development as patch-set attached to the Forge issue or as pullrequest via Github.

If you think there are checks missing about problems you encounter in your instances please report them as issue. It would be great if you directly could implement them, so others won't run into the same issues.
